\section{Problem Statement}
Define the input-output behavior of the system and the scope of the project. What is your evaluation metric for success? Collect some preliminary data, and give concrete examples of inputs and outputs. Implement a baseline and an oracle and discuss the gap. What are the challenges? Which topics (e.g., search, MDPs, etc.) might be able to address those challenges (at a high-level, since we haven't covered any techniques in detail at this point)? Search the Internet for similar projects and mention the related work. You should basically have all the infrastructure (e.g., building a simulator, cleaning data) completed to do something interesting by now.
